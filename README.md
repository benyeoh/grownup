# GROWN+UP: A "Graph Representation Of a Webpage" Network + Utilizing Pre-Training
This is the official repo of GROWN+UP and accompanying benchmarks published in the [CIKM'22 proceedings](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3511808.3557340). Latest preprint can be found on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02252).

## Introduction
The top level folder structure of this repo consists of:

1. `boilerplate-removal` - Webpage boilerplate removal benchmarks for GROWN+UP as well as other baselines mentioned in the paper.
2. `genre-classification` - Webpage genre classification benchmarks for GROWN+UP
3. `klassterfork` - A subset of an ML framework containing GROWN+UP model components and other ML training necessities to reproduce results, built on Tensorflow v2.5
